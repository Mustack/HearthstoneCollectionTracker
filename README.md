You need to run Hearthstone in 1920x1080 full screen on your main monitor. To run, start the script and go into your card collection. Hit Pause on your keyboard to begin the script. You will need to let the script run without doing anything on your computer until it's done. You can always hit Escape to stop the script and exit from it.

We get our raw data from http://hearthstonejson.com/

Dependencies

-Python: If you want to massage the raw data into the format used in the script.
-Autoit3: To run the script or compile it to an executable. https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/


Backlog:
-Remove python dependency by consuming the raw data in autoit
-Skip cards we previously had
-Support for windowed mode and different resolutions
